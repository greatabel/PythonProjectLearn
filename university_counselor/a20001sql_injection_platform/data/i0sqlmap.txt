[02:39:32] [WARNING] you've provided target URL without any GET parameters (e.g. 'http://www.site.com/article.php?id=1') and without providing any POST parameters through option '--data'
do you want to try URI injections in the target URL itself? [Y/n/q] Y

[02:40:02] [INFO] URI parameter '#1*' appears to be dynamic
[02:40:02] [WARNING] heuristic (basic) test shows that URI parameter '#1*' might not be injectable

it is recommended to perform only basic UNION tests if there is not at least one other (potential) technique found. Do you want to reduce the number of requests? [Y/n] Y
[02:40:02] [INFO] testing 'Generic UNION query (NULL) - 1 to 10 columns'
[02:40:02] [WARNING] URI parameter '#1*' does not seem to be injectable
[02:40:02] [CRITICAL] all tested parameters do not appear to be injectable. Try to increase values for '--level'/'--risk' options if you wish to perform more tests. If you suspect that there is some kind of protection mechanism involved (e.g. WAF) maybe you could try to use option '--tamper' (e.g. '--tamper=space2comment') and/or switch '--random-agent'
[02:40:02] [WARNING] HTTP error codes detected during run:
308 (Permanent Redirect) - 2 times, 404 (Not Found) - 73 times
