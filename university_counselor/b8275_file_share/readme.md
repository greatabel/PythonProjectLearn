Large Efficient Flexible and Trusty (LEFT) Files Sharing


File sharing is a commonly used network-based application in our daily life. 
There are a lot of good platforms that provided such services, such as Dropbox, Google Drive, Baidu NetDisk, iCloud, and XJTLU BOX.
 You can install their apps on your PC or mobile phone to share and synchronize your files.
This project aims at using Python Socket network programming to design and implement Large Efficient Flexible and Trusty (LEFT) Files Sharing. 
From the name of this coursework, you may obtain the requirements of this coursework:
Large:
• Format: any format, including hidden files and folders
• Size: single file is up to1GB Efficient:
• Fast: the faster, the better
• Automatic: the changed files can be synchronized automatically
• Partial update: the partially changed files can be updated partially
• Compression: compression can be used to reduce the total size Flexible:
• The IP addresses should be set as an argument
• Resume from interruption Trusty:
• No Error for any files
• Error recovery without retransmission
• Data transmission security


You can decide the following items:
Application layer protocol:
• You can design your own protocol. But HTTP is not allowed to be implemented. Transport layer protocol:
• TCP; or UDP; or Mixed.
Architecture:
• C/S; or P2P; or Mixed. Port number:
• Any port between 20000 to 30000 can be used;
• You can use one or more ports.
