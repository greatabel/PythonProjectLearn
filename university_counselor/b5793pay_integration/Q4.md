1. sequence steps:

GQ invloves 3 message betwen Alice(cliament) and verifier(bob).
Bank generate paremters for protol to work.

Alice (the Prover) generates 3 values:
x(secret)= 3
N=  101
X=  27
Alice generates a random value (y):
y= 20
Alice computes Y = y^e (mod N) and passes to Office-Bob:
Y= 21
Office-Bob generates a random value (c) and passes to Alice:
c= 85
Alice calculates z = y.x^c (mod N) and send to Office-Bob (the Verifier):
Office-Bob now computes val=z^e (mod N) and (y x^c (mod N)) and determines if they are the same
val1= 48  val2= 48
Alice has proven that he knows x

2. also illustion sequence charts in Q4.png

Let me add,in parenthesis: in fact , in Q2_b I alreay using some of 'Guillou-Quisquater (GQ) Identification', 
and made a code implementation.

3.what the bank must prepare in advance to facilitate this?
Bank must generate paremters for protol to work: generete public key and private key. Like save questions and answers before this happened.
For example: bank should know some questions and asked alice in advanced ,and save it for future's difficult
situation. When alice lost all cards , now she goto bob's brank office, now answered some pre-saved questions correctly,
now bob can trust her, gave her new private key to get her assets or trust she have rights to acess certain level of assets.
